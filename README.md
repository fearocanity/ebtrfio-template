  ## Notes and Tips

  > [!TIP]
  > - By Default, the bot will automatically run every 2 hrs. <sup>(This is our Standard Interval posting)</sup>
  > - We recommend to use `Use this Template` button rather than forking this repository.
  > - We recommend creating a Pull Request when you're setupping frames for next episode/series to track your changes and there would be a checklist to be your guide.
  > - Make sure NOT to push something in master while the BOT is running. Wait it to be finished first to avoid duplication issues.
  > - Keep your repository updated with [parent repository](https://github.com/fearocanity/ebtrfio-template) for fixes and security measure updates.
  > - When proceeding to a new Episode, you should create a new branch, and create Pull Request to your repo. <sup>(Don't forget `frameiterator` to change back to `1`)</sup>
  > - Use `action/repo-checker` as your basis for checking errors and misconfiguration.
  > - Recommended source: `Erai-Raws`, `Nyaa`.
  > - If you need help, just message us on our [<sub><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/04/Facebook_f_logo_%282021%29.svg" height="17"></sub> Facebook](https://facebook.com/btrframes) page. Or create an Issue/Discussion thread here.
  > - When using a VPS/Droplet server, just clone this repository and paste all your frames to `frames` directory, also the tokens are gonna be in `secret.sh` file.
