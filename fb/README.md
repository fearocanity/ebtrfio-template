# FB Directory
- This is where all the iterators, subtitle file and logs stored

## Notes
- As you fork this Repo, make sure to set your `frameiterator` file to `0` 
- Also, if you want subs to comment on your bot, make sure the subs come from `Erai-Raws` (Recommended Source), the scraper doesn't support all subs file formats except `*.ass`
- You can modify the filename of subs into anything, but you should edit `frameposter.sh` at [line 38](../frameposter.sh#L38)
